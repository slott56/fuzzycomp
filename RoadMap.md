A sort of TODO list with the things that have to be done moving forward to the 1.0 release of **fuzzycomp**.

# Tasks #
  * All algorithms should be fully documented.
  * Package should come with documentation supporting Sphinx.
  * All algorithms should come with exhaustive unittests
  * Tox should be used to test against Python version 2.4 - 3.2

# Algorithms #
The following algorithms should be added to future versions.

  * ~~[Tversky Index](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Tversky_index)~~

## Nice to have ##
The following algorithms would be nice to have, but will not be considered a release blocker.
